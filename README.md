# fatebook.el


## Installation 

[Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs):

```elisp
(package! fatebook
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "sonofhypnos/fatebook.el"))
```


[Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) users:

```elisp
(fatebook :location (recipe
                     :fetcher github
                     :repo "sonofhypnos/fatebook.el"))
```

[straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el)

``` emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(fatebook :type git :host github :repo "sonofhypnos/fatebook.el"))
```

## Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonofhypnos/fatebook.el.git
```

2. Add the directory to your `load-path`. In your `.emacs` or `init.el`, add:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/fatebook.el")
```

Replace `"/path/to/fatebook.el"` with the actual path to the directory.

3. Load the package:

```elisp
(require 'fatebook)
```


## Storing your api-keys


### TLDR: 
open `~/.authinfo.gpg` with emacs:

``` sh
emacs ~/.authinfo.gpg
```

Emacs will prompt you for a password to encrypt the file (you can also use `~/.authinfo` if you don't want to encrypt your secrets (not recommended!)).

Add this line to the file:

``` sh
machine fatebook.io login defaultUser password $your-api-key
```

Replace $your-api-key with your api key found under https://fatebook.io/api-setup and leave the remaining fields the same.

### Long version


For the longer explanation see this section I stole from [(ghub)Getting Started](https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/Storing-a-Token.html):

> Please also see [(auth)Top](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/auth/index.html#Top) for all the gory details about Auth-Source.

> The variable auth-sources controls how and where Auth-Source keeps its secrets. The default value is a list of three files: ("~/.authinfo" "~/.authinfo.gpg" "~/.netrc"), but to avoid confusion you should make sure that only one of these files exists and then you should also adjust the value of the variable to only ever use that file, for example:

> (setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo"))

> In ~/.authinfo secrets are stored in plain text. If you donâ€™t want that, then you should use the encrypted ~/.authinfo.gpg instead:

> (setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg"))

> Auth-Source also supports storing secrets in various external key-chains. See [(auth)Top](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/auth/index.html#Top) for more information. 

> The default Auth-Source backends only support storing three values per entry; the "machine", the "login" and the "password".

If you want fatebook.el to be able to find your api key use `fatebook.io` for machine and `defaultUser` for user.




``` sh
machine fatebook.io login defaultUser password $your-api-key
```

replace $your-api-key with your api key and leave the remaining fields the same.

## Configuration

By default, fatebook.el uses org-read-date to pick a date. If you don't want to load the whole of org for this package, set `fatebook-use-org-read-date` to nil in your config or in the customization interface.
